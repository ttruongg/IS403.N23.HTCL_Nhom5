# USING STATISTICAL MODEL AND MACHINE LEARNING FOR GOLD PRICE PREDICTION 

This report presents a comparative analysis of nine models,
including Linear Regression, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU),
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Exponential Smoothing (ETS),
Random Forest, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN), Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR), and Recurrent Neural Network
(RNN), for predicting gold prices. The models are evaluated
using MAE, MAPE, and RMSE metrics on historical gold price
indicators data. The model with the lowest MAE, MAPE, and
RMSE is recommended for gold price forecasting, contributing
to improved understanding and accurate predictions in the gold
market.
